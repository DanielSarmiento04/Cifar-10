# Neural_network_object_classifier
This repo contain  the code to train a simple object classier using #tensorlfow

The datasets has obtain usign the load datasets by tensorflow

The neural Network is build consider the size of the classes, the kind of object and the performarce optimization


Resumen First architecture tested
